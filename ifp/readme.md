## Ideas for Improvement

1. Pi-Pi interaction term currently doesnâ€™t change / maybe slightly degrades performance
2. Salt bridge terms don't take into account alternative resonance structures
   - It would be somewhat straightforward to take this into account on the protein side
   - Ligand side would be much more challenging
   - I don't think this is a super high priority since there are relavively few such cases
