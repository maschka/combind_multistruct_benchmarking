Created by Joe Paggi 2016.

This code is a variant of binana that:
   Accepts a wide array of input file types
   Runs significantly faster
   Has easier to parse output

   Accepts any of the following inputs:
	A ligand-protein complex
	A protein and a glide pose viewer file
	A ligand and protein file with ligand in binding pose

   Reports floating point scores for some interaction types
   ... Can adjust output in residue.py
   
This code is invoked by calling fuzzyifp.py, see this file for input parameters.

Tech debt / future changes that need to be made:
  1) Improve code for adding bonds, I think the best option is to use bonds given in .mae instead of inferring them
  2) Update scoring functions, most are pretty arbitrary at this point
  3) Improve documentation
  4) Add functionality for detecting water mediated contacts
  5) General refactoring
