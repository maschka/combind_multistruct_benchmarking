# Statistics Computation, Scoring Function, Optimization Procedure

This directory is the core of the combind method.

## Ideas for Improvement
- Take into account dependencies between triplets of poses (or higher)
- Take into account metrics for an entire set of poses i.e. fraction making a given hydrogen bond.
- Implement interactions at a residue level, with residue specific stats
- Change optimization procedure to take into account confidence in each prediction
