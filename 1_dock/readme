STRUCTURE OF A SINGLE DATA DIRECTORY:

raw_pdbs/:
    pdb_list.txt: new-line seperated list of PDB IDs for the structures in the given family
    $PDBID.pdb: all of the downloaded files from the PDB

exp_ligands/:
    $PDBID_ligand.mae: if we are given a D3R dataset, the script will automatically grab the SMILE strings in the dataset and convert them to mae ligand files
    NOTE: Some of these ligand names have "_" in them, which messes up the script - therefore, all "_" before "*_ligand.mae" should be deleted

stipped/:
    $PDBID.pdb: the same files from raw_pdbs except that only one structure/ligand should be present, the waters should be removed, and the structures should all be aligned

processed/:
    $PDBID.pdb: same files from stripped except that we run them through Schrodinger's prep program so that they are ready for docking

ligands/:
    $PDBID_ligand.mae: each ligand corresponds to the ligand for the $PDBID structure

glide/:
    $PDBID_ligand-to-$PDBID/:
        $PDBID_ligand-to-$PDBID.*: these files are all automatically generated by GLIDE and will all have the same name as the directory that we specify to GLIDE

exp_glide/:
    $EXPLIGANDID_ligand-to-$GRID/: same as from glide/ except now we are docking the exp_ligands to the grids
