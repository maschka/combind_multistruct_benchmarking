# Commands to generate panels of figure 1
# This figure is currently using AR as an
# example as there are two cartoonishly conserved
# hydrogen bond (and a pi-pi but we're not currently
# showing it). When making the crystal pose panels
# you should begin by running "load_complexes AR, 20".
# For the glide poses, just load the relevant
# pose viewer.
